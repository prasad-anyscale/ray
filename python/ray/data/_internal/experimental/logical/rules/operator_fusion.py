"""Actor-only-backend overrides for operator fusion.

Active only when ``actor_only_backend_enabled()`` is true. Swapped into the physical
ruleset in place of the OSS :class:`FuseOperators` by
``ray.data._internal.logical.optimizers`` (see ``_maybe_install_actor_only_rules``).

Relative to OSS fusion, this rule (all gating lives in :meth:`_can_fuse`, so it
applies uniformly to the Map->Map, Map->AllToAll, and
MapBatches->StreamingRepartition loops):
  * honors the ``fusion_enabled()`` kill switch, and
  * additionally allows Actor->Actor fusion, restricted by
    :meth:`_fuse_compute_strategy` to operators with identical compute
    strategies.
